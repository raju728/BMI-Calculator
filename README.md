# BMI Calculator (Android version)
* Calculates [BMI](https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/articles/health/bmi-formula-for-bmi-calculations.php) of user to know his/her current body weight
* This program will use both Metric (kg/m) and Imperial (lb/in) BMI formula 
* After getting the results, user will know his/her BMI category (underweight, obese, overweight or normal)
* To determine which BMI category is the user, metric units will be used instead of imperial units
* However, imperial units version of the result will still be shown as per reference of user and comparison
* Based on the [Java program](https://github.com/iasjem/bmi-calculator-java) I created weeks ago on Github
* Created to simply practice coding in Android using Java
